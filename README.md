# Football Analytics — Project Report Landing Page

This repository contains a simple front-end-only landing page you can use to document a football analytics project. It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or build step required.

Files included

- `index.html` — the editable landing page (open this in your browser).
- `styles.css` — lightweight styling for layout and responsive behavior.
- `script.js` — autosave to `localStorage`, Download HTML, Export Markdown, Print, and Reset features.

Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or serve it via a static server).
2. Click into any heading, paragraph, or list — all areas are editable and autosave to your browser's `localStorage`.
3. Use the top-right buttons to `Save`, `Download HTML`, `Export Markdown`, `Print`, or `Reset` the page.

Notes

- All data is stored locally in your browser; nothing is uploaded or sent externally.
- To share a report, use `Download HTML` or `Export Markdown`.

If you'd like, I can add features next: PDF export, GitHub Gist sync, Git integration, or a small backend to persist reports.
